# React Redux App - Advices App

This is a simple todo list app built with React, Redux and Webpack. I built this app during my [tutorial series on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQDnxXqV213JJFtDaG0aE9vqvp6Wm7nBg).

After following the series tutorial, the following App is modified to be an Advices App
- Advices CRUD operations
- Users CRUD operations

## List of Problems
This are some problems I run into:
- Make commit in new branch and checkout without push
* That lead to get my files blocked when I checkout from master to new branch
* Try changing permissions but it didn't solve. Later, try to push if those changes may be sent to GitHub but it didn't work.
* Search for solutions. Come across with these: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4114095/how-to-revert-git-repository-to-a-previous-commit
* Final: close text editor, let it delete files, use stackoverflow link, get HEAD to go to previous commit, got files, get back to current state, and paste files.
